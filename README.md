# High-Performance GPT2 Optimization

This repository provides a comprehensive optimization framework for the GPT-2 language model, integrating multiple model compression and acceleration techniques including Knowledge Distillation, LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), and Weight Pruning, alongside FlashAttention and quantization support. It systematically measures training and inference performance across different configurations.

## 📖 Project Overview

This project researches and implements the combined effects of the following model optimization techniques:

1. Knowledge Distillation: Transferring knowledge from larger "teacher" models to smaller "student" models
2. LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation): Inserting a small number of trainable parameters through low-rank matrix decomposition while keeping most model weights frozen
3. Weight Pruning: Identifying and removing unimportant parameter connections to reduce model size and computational complexity
4. FlashAttention: Optimized implementation to accelerate attention mechanism computations
5. Quantization: Reducing weight precision from FP32/ FP16 to INT4

## 🔧 Setup

1. **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **(Optional) Login to Weights & Biases:**

   ```bash
   wandb login
   ```

## 🚀 Usage

### Execution Sequence

1. First, run the distillation experiments to create the distilled model:

   ~~~bash
   python distillation/run\_distillation\_experiments.py
   ~~~

   This script performs knowledge distillation from GPT-2-medium (teacher) to GPT-2 (student), creating checkpoints at specified epochs (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50). The distilled model will be saved in the distilled\_model directory.
2. Next, compare the distilled model with GPT-2 and GPT-2-medium:

   ~~~bash
   python distillation/model_comparison.py
   ~~~

   This will evaluate the performance of all three models (GPT-2, GPT-2-medium, and the distilled model) and generate comparison metrics including loss, perplexity, inference time, and memory usage.
3. For LoRA and pruning experiments, run the Jupyter notebook:

   ~~~bash
   jupyter notebook Distillation-with-Lora-and-Pruning.ipynb
   ~~~

   This notebook demonstrates how to apply LoRA and pruning techniques to the distilled model for further optimization.
4. FlashAttention and quantization experiments:

   ```bash

   jupyte notebook Quantization-with-Flash-Attention.ipynb
   ```
